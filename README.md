# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 2000 icons – [302 crypto, and fiat currencies](Coin List.md), in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All I ask is that you don’t claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in 32×32, 64×64(@2x), and 128×128 variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you’re looking for that hasn’t been included, please create a new issue and I shall include it.

## Building 🛠

The build system requires node and npm to be installed on your system.  After they are installed you can install the npm dependencies with

    npm install

You can then build with

    npm run build

## Donate ☕️

If you find these icons useful, or if you’ve used them for your projects, please consider making a donation. I have invested over 120 hours in creating and maintaining this project, and your donations will help ensure it continues.
