# Cryptocurrency Icons

[This project](http://cryptoicons.co) contains over 6000 icons – almost 400 crypto currencies, in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All we ask is that you don’t claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

We also have some fiat currencies: `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`, `JPY`, `CNY`, `RUB`. *(We don't intend to add more)*

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in `32×32`, `32×32 (2x)`, and `128×128` variants, along with SVG versions.

There's also a [`generic` icon](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/blob/master/svg/color/generic.svg) that can be used for cryptocurrencies missing an icon here.

If there is an altcoin you’re looking for that hasn’t been included, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=coin+request&template=add-currency.md&title=Add+Currency+%28Symbol%29).<br><sub>(We don't accept pull request contributions for new or updated icons at this time. Open an issue and we'll do the icon for you.)</sub>


## Install 🚀

```
$ npm install cryptocurrency-icons
```

You can then import the icons from `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons`, for example `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons/svg/color/kmd.svg`.

There's also a `manifest.json` file included in the package with a list of the currency symbol and name of the icons.
