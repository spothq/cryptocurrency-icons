# Cryptocurrency Icons

This download contains over 2000 icons – 161 crypto, and fiat currencies, in 4 styles and a range of sizes. Completely free. All I ask is that you don’t claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.

Images are in the PNG format (transparent) in 32×32, 64×64(@2x), 128×128, and 256×256(@2x) variants, along with SVG versions.

If there is an altcoin you’re looking for that hasn’t been included, please create a new issue and I shall include it.
